# Glitch Sync Template

[Glitch](https://glitch.com/) is a super cool platform that lets you edit, collaborate, and publish your [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) apps. It does have [GitHub](https://github.com/UXSoc/UX-glitch) (also where you can get the source) support but lacks a lot of features.

This is a template to enable a lot of extra functionality, and is great way to do CD/CI.

Glitch is perfect for bots, small projects, and fun apps. Here's why you should consider using this template: 
### Pros

- Free as in pizza 🍕 and source code 📖, through hosting with Glitch.
- Relatively easy to setup, with full and extendable control over how deployments work. 
- Gets all the benefits of Glitch (collaboration, live code) with a convenient way to reset changes after saving them through GitHUb.

### Cons

- Only supports Node.js.
- Glitch has resource [restrictions](https://glitch.com/help/restrictions/) in place, although they are hard to hit or can be circumvented.
- Glitch API is unfortunately not dependable, use at your own risk.
